## Shared dir

Docker shares _workspace_ dir with Kali and Parrot containers, you can put your own scripts inside.

## Generate documentation

On pentesting lab shell, you can also generate, through Docker container based on [asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor), the thesis paper using _4) Generate documentation_ option.

## Expose ports

_run-docker-lab.sh_ is able to expose Kali and Parrot containers's ports. You will find this option on _Start Lab_ menu.
